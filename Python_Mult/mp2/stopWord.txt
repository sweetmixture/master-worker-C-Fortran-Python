Hi all,

Myriad's filesystem was up again from 17:30 yesterday, but we're still at risk, encountering problems and experiencing periods of unresponsiveness of several minutes while Lustre failover and recovery happens.

We found that we had an initial Object Store Server reboot and failover yesterday, then hit a Lustre bug during recovery, and the OSSes were then getting stuck while attempting to save crash dumps and reboot - this is why the filesystem wasn't successfully coming back up.

We have changed some configuration so that nodes should correctly recover even after hitting this bug.

We're running at risk still, because the Lustre bug is still reoccurring from time to time and results in several minutes of unresponsiveness while Lustre failover and recovery happens. 

We're looking at whether we can schedule a Lustre software upgrade during Myriad's planned outage on 10-15 May (https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Planned_Outages/), since the bug we are currently experiencing is fixed in the next minor version.

We do have some longer-term filesystem changes in the works, with an additional cross-site filesystem first and a replacement of Scratch later - more information to come when we have more concrete details and timelines. This is just to inform you that improvements will be coming.

Please send any queries to rc-support@ucl.ac.uk
